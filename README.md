#  Hi, I'm `Jonathan` `//J535D165`

I'm a research software engineer and community organizer who is working on advancing scientific research with modern technology. The scientific projects I work on cover a wide range of areas like computer science, social science, and humanities. My favorite topics are [data linkage](https://www.github.com/J535D165/recordlinkage), reproducible workflows, and APIs. Recently, I started working on stimulating the development and re-use of Open Source software at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science/tracks/fair-data-and-software). 

At the moment, I'm busy with COVID-19 related research projects. Check out our machine learning software to read academic literature on coronaviruses ([ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview)), and COVID-19 case counts dataset [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
