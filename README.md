#  Hi, I'm `Jonathan` `//J535D165`

Ever wondered what the ideal *(scientific) workflow* would look like? And what kind of tools you need for it? It's maybe an impossible question to anser, but many will say the workflow should be **efficient**, **transparent**, and **reproducible**. I don't know the answer as well, but I fully support these principles. Over the past years, I'm using my GitHub profile to share and collaborate on projects to support the ideal academic workflow. The following projects are my top interest at the moment:

- **Data Access**: You should definitely check out **[Datahugger :open_hands:](https://github.com/j535d165/datahugger)**, the easiest way to download scientific data! Other projects are **[pyalex](https://github.com/j535d165/pyalex)** (new!), **[cbsodata](https://github.com/j535d165/cbsodata)**, and **[rispy](https://github.com/MrTango/rispy)**. 

- **Faster reading**: Can we make systematic reviews fun to work on by using AI for the boring üí§ parts? With **[ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview)** and [asreview.ai](https://asreview.ai), we speed up systematic reviewing. I'm lead of ASReview' developers team. 

- **Transparent workflows**: I'm experimenting with projects like **[scitree](https://github.com/j535d165/scitree)** and **[scisort](https://github.com/j535d165/scisort)**, which help and promote to use repoducible project folder structures.

- **Data Linkage**: I work on projects like **[recordlinkage](https://github.com/j535d165/recordlinkage)** and **[List of data matching software](https://github.com/j535d165/data-matching-software)**. Sometimes my attention is a bit lost with these project, but they are still close to my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Besides this, you can find me at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science/tracks/fair-data-and-software) (The Netherlands) as the project lead of the open and [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) Data and Software movement.
