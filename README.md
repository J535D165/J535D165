#  Hi, I'm `Jonathan` `//J535D165`

I'm a research software engineer and community organizer who is working on advancing scientific research with modern technology. The scientific projects I work on cover a wide range of areas like computer science, social science, and humanities. My favorite topics are [data linkage](https://www.github.com/J535D165/recordlinkage), reproducible workflows, and APIs. I'm project lead of the open and [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) Data and Software movement at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/open-science/tracks/fair-data-and-software).
